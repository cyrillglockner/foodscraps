# Foodscrap location bot 

This chatbot example is always up to date delivering food scrap location information based on the latest from 
the NYC Open Data project. 

# Background

This dataset contains information on locations within NYC where you can drop-off your food scraps to make compost, not trash. All food scraps are processed locally at community scale compost sites.
